# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This project entailed using HTML to markup the raw text of a letter- 
transforming it into a well organized and visually appealing letter.
It was created solely using HTML and css, but the HTML controls the 
majority of the appearence of the site.

## Running the program

To run the site, clone this repository to a new directory in your file
browser. Then, using Visual Studio Code, open the project and run the 
website via the `index.html` file. 

Alternatively, you can view the webpage using the `Show Preview` option
if you have the LivePreview plugin installed.
